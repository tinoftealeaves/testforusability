    <th> <h2> Sussex </h2>

        <p> Sussex is an area within South East England that was historically a kingdom and, later, a county. It includes the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. <br> <br>
            Sussex is widely regarded as a single unified entity for some purposes, including provision of some public services, food and drink and sport. In 2007, Sussex Day was created to celebrate the county's culture and history.  </p>

    <th> <h2> Norland Park </h2>

        <p>Norland Park is an estate located in Sussex, which has belonged to the Dashwood family for generations. <br> <br>

            Upon the death of his aunt, Henry Dashwood and his second wife moved to Norland Park with their young daughters to keep his elderly and childless uncle company. When that uncle died ten years later, Mr. Dashwood inherited the estate, but under the terms of the bequest, Mr. Dashwood could not sell or alter any of the property so it passed intact to his grandson Harry. <br> <br>
            
            Mr. Dashwood died a year later, and Norland passed to his son from his first marriage, John Dashwood. John's wife Fanny quickly established herself as mistress, and she made their home so inhospitable that Mrs. Dashwood moved to Barton Cottage with her daughters. </p></th>

        <p>Barton Park is an estate located in Devonshire. It is owned by Sir John Middleton, a relative of Mrs. Dashwood's. Sir John offers the use of the small cottage located on the grounds when he hears of her predicament with Norland Park. <br> <br>

            Barton Park is half a mile away from Barton Cottage. The house is large and elegant. </p></th>

    <th> <h2> Barton Cottage </h2>

        <p> Barton Cottage is a small house where Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters lived after being evicted from Norland Park. It is located on the outskirts of Barton Park, the estate owned by Sir John and Lady Middleton. Sir John, Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, offered the house to her at an "uncommonly moderate" rent when he heard she had been widowed and left in financial difficulty. <br> <br>

             A narrow passage leads through the house to the garden behind, and on each side of the passage is a sitting room, about sixteen feet square. There are four bedrooms and two garrets. Mrs. Dashwood hopes to make alterations to the house, but cannot afford it at her present income when she has never saved before in her life.  </p>
