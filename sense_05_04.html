      <p> Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship. </p>
      <p> But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of <a href="characters.html" style="color: black; background-color: #f29553;"> Mrs. Ferrars's </a> resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that <a href="characters.html" style="color: black; background-color: #f29553;"> Mrs. Dashwood </a> could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations. </p>
      <p> In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in  <a href="locations.html" style="color: black; background-color:var( --dark-blue);"> Devonshire. </a> The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to <a href="locations.html" style="color: black; background-color:var( --dark-blue);"> Barton Park, </a> the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether <a href="locations.html" style="color: black; background-color:var( --dark-blue);"> Barton Cottage, </a> for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her. </p>
    <p> He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from <a href="locations.html" style="color: black; background-color:var( --dark-blue);"> Sussex </a> as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. </p>
